# Karpenter vs. EKS Managed Node Groups

This document compares AWS Karpenter with EKS Managed Node Groups to help you choose the right scaling approach.

## Karpenter

**Pros:**

* Fine-grained provisioning based on workload needs
* Supports both x86 and ARM instance types
* Launches nodes just-in-time
* Spot instance support with interruption handling
* Flexible pricing optimizations

**Cons:**

* More complex configuration and IAM setup
* CRDs (e.g., `Provisioner`, `NodePool`) must be maintained

## EKS Managed Node Groups

**Pros:**

* Easy to configure with Terraform or Console
* Built-in integration with EKS
* Suitable for fixed or predictable workloads

**Cons:**

* Less flexible instance type selection
* Slower scaling response
* Higher cost when using only on-demand

## Recommendation

Use **Karpenter** for:

* Dynamic or bursty workloads
* Cost-sensitive environments
* Multi-architecture (x86 & ARM) support

Use **Managed Node Groups** for:

* Stable baseline workloads
* Simplicity and operational ease
* Teams unfamiliar with custom autoscaling logic
